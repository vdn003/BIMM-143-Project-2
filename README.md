# BIMM-143-Project-2


Scientific question:
Dermititus is known to go away with age. 10% of children are diagnosed with demritis then grow out of it. Only 1% of adults observe dermatitis. So then the protein linked to dermatitis by being a component in building up the skin barrier(this linkage has currently only been tested in mice studies but the protein is found in both humans and mice) CTIP2 shouldn't really differ in terms of structure between ages. CTIP2 is found to actual be expressed fewer in adult healthy mice then when developing embryos. So then how closely related and similar are the CTIP2 protein in mice is to humans in order to make any assumption that CTIP2 is also linked to dermatitis in humans?

Scientific hypothesis:
If the human and mouse CTIP2 protein are closely related, then we can assume their structures and links to the dermatitis pathway and other properties of their proteins to also be similar.


Files for needed to run my project 2:
The "Human CTIP2.fasta" file is the nucleotide DNA sequnce for the CTIP2 protein found in humans. For dataset 1.
The "Mouse CTIP2.fasta" file is the nucleotide DNA sequnce for the CTIP2 protein found in mice. For dataset 1.
"Project 2 dataset2.tgz" is the RNAseqdataset for dataset 2.
