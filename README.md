Background:
Dermatitis is a skin condition where one may have overly dry and weak skin which can then be prone to infections, redness, and other ailments. Dermatitis is known to go away with age. 10% of children are diagnosed with dermatitis then grow out of it, while only 1% of adults observe dermatitis (Golonzhka O, Leid M, Indra G, Indra AK. Expression of COUP-TF-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2) in mouse skin during development and in adulthood. Gene Expr Patterns. 2007 Aug;7(7):754-60. doi: 10.1016/j.modgep.2007.06.002. Epub 2007 Jun 13. PMID: 17631058; PMCID: PMC2063996.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8383845/). So then the protein linked to dermatitis by being a component in building up the skin barrier (this linkage has currently only been tested in mice studies but the protein itself is found in both humans and mice). CTIP2 is found to actual be expressed fewer in adult healthy mice then when developing embryos based on research findings(Ganguli-Indra G, Liang X, Hyter S, Leid M, Hanifin J, Indra AK. Expression of COUP-TF-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2) in human atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis skin. Exp Dermatol. 2009 Nov;18(11):994-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2009.00876.x. Epub 2009 Mar 29. PMID: 19366371; PMCID: PMC2783464. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366371/). CTIP2 is also sometimes called as BC11B, so some data may also be named BC11B.

Scientific question:
So then how closely similar are the CTIP2 protein in mice are to humans (in terms of DNA sequence and protein structure), in order to make an assumption that CTIP2 is also linked to dermatitis in humans?

Scientific hypothesis:
If the human and mouse CTIP2 protein are closely similar, then we can assume their protein structures and DNA sequences to be similar as well.


Files needed to run my project 2 code:

The "Human CTIP2.fasta" file is the nucleotide DNA sequnce for the CTIP2 protein found in humans. For dataset 1.

The "Mouse CTIP2.fasta" file is the nucleotide DNA sequnce for the CTIP2 protein found in mice. For dataset 1.

The "BC11B_HUMAN.pdb" file is the protein structure for CTIP2 in humans. For dataset 2.

The "BC11B_MOUSE.pdb" file is the protein structure for CTIP2 in mice. For dataset 2.
